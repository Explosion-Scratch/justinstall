- Supports installation from GitHub repositories, direct URLs, and local files
- Handles various file formats: .tar.gz, .zip, .dmg, .app, .pkg, and .deb
- Automatically detects system architecture and platform for compatibility
- Installs binaries to ~/.local/bin
- Supports macOS, Linux, and partially supports FreeBSD and OpenBSD
- Provides interactive prompts for user confirmation during installation
- Handles code signing and quarantine removal for macOS applications

  Confirmation for overwriting

## Disclaimer
Don't use on windows. I don't have windows so I haven't tested it on windows. It would probably still work well for binaries though.

This tool attempts to install software as safely as possible, but I'm not responsible if you install malware of if this breaks your system or harms anything in any way directly or indirectly. Always verify the source and contents of packages before installation.

Less scary note: I've included confirmations for many operations as a failsafe.

### Why's does the recording have errors:
<small>Ignore the mise errors, I uninstalled it before recording to install it again. Also the regex thought it detected an install script but it didn't.</small>
